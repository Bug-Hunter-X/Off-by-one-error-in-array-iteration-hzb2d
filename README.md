This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through an array. The bug.java file contains the erroneous code, resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bugSolution.java file provides the corrected code.  The error stems from using 'i <= arr.length' in the for loop condition which attempts to access an element beyond the array's bounds.
